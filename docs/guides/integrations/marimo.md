# Marimo

[Marimo](https://docs.marimo.io/) is an open-source reactive Python notebook. An improved version of Jupyter notebooks, Marimo allows you to build data applications with interactive widgets and reactive cells.

Ordeq integrates seamlessly with Marimo, enabling you to create interactive data applications that leverage Ordeq's capabilities.

You can find an example of using Ordeq with Marimo in the [repository's examples section](https://github.com/ing-bank/ordeq/tree/main/examples)
