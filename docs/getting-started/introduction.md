# Introduction

We have all been there. As your data project grows:

- Logic gets tightly coupled
- Repetitive tasks are duplicated
- Complexity increases

Ordeq tackles these problems by providing a simple yet powerful way to define IO and transformations throughout your
project.

## How Ordeq helps

Let's see how Ordeq helps you develop data pipelines.
We will start with a simple example.
Here is how a simple data pipeline looks like without Ordeq:

```python title="__main__.py"
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

if __name__ == '__main__':
    spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
    txs = spark.table('txs')
    clients = spark.table('clients')
    txs_and_clients = txs.join(clients, on='client_id', how='left')
    txs_and_clients.write.mode('overwrite').saveAsTable('txs_and_clients')
```

!!! example "Ordeq works with any data processing tool"
    The example above uses PySpark, since it is a popular data processing tool, but the same principles apply to other tools.
    If you are not familiar with Spark, imagine the same logic implemented with Pandas, Dask, or another tool of your choice.

Suppose we want to add a bit more logic, such as filtering the data by a certain date:

```python hl_lines="6 7 8 10" title="__main__.py"
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from argparse import ArgumentParser

if __name__ == '__main__':
    spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
    parser = ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--date", type=str)
    date = parser.parse_args().date
    txs = spark.table('txs')
    txs = txs.filter(txs.date == date)
    clients = spark.table('clients')
    txs_and_clients = txs.join(clients, on='client_id', how='left')
    txs_and_clients.write.mode('overwrite').saveAsTable('txs_and_clients')
```

The code is getting more complex, and now you have to pass the date argument every time you run the script.
Also, the logic is still tightly coupled, and you cannot easily reuse parts of it.

### Improvements

Can we do better?
Let's try to modularize the logic by splitting it into functions:

```python hl_lines="5 6 8 9 11-14 16-18" title="__main__.py"
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from argparse import ArgumentParser
from pyspark.sql import DataFrame

def load_table(spark: SparkSession, table: str) -> DataFrame:
    return spark.table(table)

def save_table(df: DataFrame, table: str):
    df.write.mode('overwrite').saveAsTable(table)

def parse_date() -> str:
    parser = ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--date", type=str)
    return parser.parse_args().date

def join_txs_and_clients(txs: DataFrame, clients: DataFrame, date: str):
    txs = txs.filter(txs.date == date)
    return txs.join(clients, on='client_id', how='left')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
    date = parse_date()
    txs = load_table(spark, 'txs')
    clients = load_table(spark, 'clients')
    txs_and_clients = join_txs_and_clients(txs, clients, date)
    save_table(txs_and_clients, 'txs_and_clients')
```

This is much better! Each piece of logic can be tested in isolation.
You can reuse the functions in other parts of your project.
However, there are still some challenges.
You still need to route `spark`, `date`, `txs` and `clients` through the functions.
This _couples_ the IO with the transformations.

### The Ordeq solution

Ordeq dissolves the coupling by separating IO, like Spark tables and command line argument, from the transformations.
While the transformations reside in `nodes.py`, IOs are defined in a separate `catalog` module.
Lastly, a `__main__.py` module takes care of running the job:

=== "nodes.py"
    ```python
    from ordeq import node
    import catalog

    @node(
        inputs=[catalog.txs, catalog.clients, catalog.date],
        outputs=catalog.txs_and_clients
    )
    def join_txs_and_clients(
        txs: DataFrame,
        clients: DataFrame
        date: str
    ) -> DataFrame:
        txs = txs.filter(txs.date == date)
        return txs.join(clients, on='client_id', how='left')
    ```

=== "catalog.py"
    ```python
    from ordeq_args import CommandLineArg
    from ordeq_spark import SparkHiveTable

    date = CommandLineArg("--date", type=str)
    txs = SparkHiveTable(table="txs")
    clients = SparkHiveTable(table="clients")
    txs_and_clients = SparkHiveTable(table="txs_and_clients")
    ```

=== "\__main__.py"
    ```python
    from ordeq import run
    from nodes import join_txs_and_clients

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run(join_txs_and_clients)
    ```

The idea behind the separation is that changes to the IO should not affect the transformations, and vice versa.
Furthermore, the separation helps you keep your project organized.

### Decoupling in practice

#### Changing IO

Say you want to read the transactions from a Iceberg table instead of a Hive table,
you only need to change `catalog.py`.

=== "nodes.py"
    ```python
    from ordeq import node
    import catalog

    @node(
        inputs=[catalog.txs, catalog.clients, catalog.date],
        outputs=catalog.txs_and_clients
    )
    def join_txs_and_clients(
        txs: DataFrame,
        clients: DataFrame
        date: str
    ) -> DataFrame:
        txs = txs.filter(txs.date == date)
        return txs.join(clients, on='client_id', how='left')
    ```

=== "catalog.py"
    ```python hl_lines="5"
    from ordeq_args import CommandLineArg
    from ordeq_spark import SparkHiveTable

    date = CommandLineArg("--date", type=str)
    txs = SparkIcebergTable(table="txs")
    clients = SparkHiveTable(table="clients")
    txs_and_clients = SparkHiveTable(table="txs_and_clients")
    ```

=== "\__main__.py"
    ```python
    from ordeq import run
    from nodes import join_txs_and_clients

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run(join_txs_and_clients)
    ```

Or, maybe the date comes from an environment variable instead of a command line argument:

=== "nodes.py"
    ```python
    from ordeq import node
    import catalog

    @node(
        inputs=[catalog.txs, catalog.clients, catalog.date],
        outputs=catalog.txs_and_clients
    )
    def join_txs_and_clients(
        txs: DataFrame,
        clients: DataFrame
        date: str
    ) -> DataFrame:
        txs = txs.filter(txs.date == date)
        return txs.join(clients, on='client_id', how='left')
    ```

=== "catalog.py"
    ```python hl_lines="1 4"
    from ordeq_args import EnvironmentVariable
    from ordeq_spark import SparkIcebergTable, SparkHiveTable

    date = EnvironmentVariable("DATE")
    txs = SparkIcebergTable(table="txs")
    clients = SparkHiveTable(table="clients")
    txs_and_clients = SparkHiveTable(table="txs_and_clients")
    ```

=== "\__main__.py"
    ```python
    from ordeq import run
    from nodes import join_txs_and_clients

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run(join_txs_and_clients)
    ```

Perhaps you want to append data to the `txs_and_clients` table instead of overwriting it:

=== "nodes.py"
    ```python
    from ordeq import node
    import catalog

    @node(
        inputs=[catalog.txs, catalog.clients, catalog.date],
        outputs=catalog.txs_and_clients
    )
    def join_txs_and_clients(
        txs: DataFrame,
        clients: DataFrame
        date: str
    ) -> DataFrame:
        txs = txs.filter(txs.date == date)
        return txs.join(clients, on='client_id', how='left')
    ```

=== "catalog.py"
    ```python hl_lines="7-11"
    from ordeq_args import EnvironmentVariable
    from ordeq_spark import SparkIcebergTable, SparkHiveTable

    date = EnvironmentVariable("DATE")
    txs = SparkIcebergTable(table="txs")
    clients = SparkHiveTable(table="clients")
    txs_and_clients = SparkHiveTable(
        table="txs_and_clients"
    ).with_save_options(
        mode="append"
    )
    ```

=== "\__main__.py"
    ```python
    from ordeq import run
    from nodes import join_txs_and_clients

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run(join_txs_and_clients)
    ```

All changes above require only amendments to `catalog.py`.
The transformations in `nodes.py` remain unchanged.
Furthermore, each IO is defined once and can be reused throughout your project.

#### Changing transformations

Vice versa, if you want to change the logic of how transactions and clients are joined, you only need to change `nodes.py`.
For example, you might want to filter out inactive clients and transactions with a non-positive amount:

=== "nodes.py"
    ```python hl_lines="14-17"
    from ordeq import node
    import catalog

    @node(
        inputs=[catalog.txs, catalog.clients, catalog.date],
        outputs=catalog.txs_and_clients
    )
    def join_txs_and_clients(
        txs: DataFrame,
        clients: DataFrame
        date: str
    ) -> DataFrame:
        txs = txs.filter(txs.date == date)
        txs_and_clients = txs.join(clients, on='client_id', how='inner')
        return txs_and_clients.where(
            (txs_and_clients.amount > 0) & (txs_and_clients.status == 'active')
        )
    ```

=== "catalog.py"
    ```python hl_lines="7-11"
    from ordeq_args import EnvironmentVariable
    from ordeq_spark import SparkIcebergTable, SparkHiveTable

    date = EnvironmentVariable("DATE")
    txs = SparkIcebergTable(table="txs")
    clients = SparkHiveTable(table="clients")
    txs_and_clients = SparkHiveTable(
        table="txs_and_clients"
    ).with_save_options(
        mode="append"
    )
    ```

=== "\__main__.py"
    ```python
    from ordeq import run
    from nodes import join_txs_and_clients

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run(join_txs_and_clients)
    ```

The example above only changes the `join_txs_and_clients` node.
What if we want to add more nodes?
For example, we might want to add a node that aggregates the transaction amount by client:

=== "nodes.py"
    ```python hl_lines="19-26"
    from ordeq import node
    import catalog

    @node(
        inputs=[catalog.txs, catalog.clients, catalog.date],
        outputs=catalog.txs_and_clients
    )
    def join_txs_and_clients(
        txs: DataFrame,
        clients: DataFrame
        date: str
    ) -> DataFrame:
        txs = txs.filter(txs.date == date)
        txs_and_clients = txs.join(clients, on='client_id', how='inner')
        return txs_and_clients.where(
            (txs_and_clients.amount > 0) & (txs_and_clients.status == 'active')
        )

    @node(
        inputs=catalog.txs_and_clients,
        outputs=catalog.aggregated_txs
    )
    def aggregate_txs(txs_and_clients: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:
        return txs_and_clients.groupBy('client_id').sum('amount')
    ```

=== "catalog.py"
    ```python hl_lines="12-16"
    from ordeq_args import EnvironmentVariable
    from ordeq_spark import SparkIcebergTable, SparkHiveTable

    date = EnvironmentVariable("DATE")
    txs = SparkIcebergTable(table="txs")
    clients = SparkHiveTable(table="clients")
    txs_and_clients = SparkHiveTable(
        table="txs_and_clients"
    ).with_save_options(
        mode="append"
    )
    aggregated_txs = SparkHiveTable(
        table="aggregated_txs"
    ).with_save_options(
        partition_by="date"
    )
    ```

=== "\__main__.py"
    ```python hl_lines="5"
    from ordeq import run
    from nodes import join_txs_and_clients, aggregate_txs

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run(join_txs_and_clients, aggregate_txs)
    ```

This example shows how easy it is to grow and maintain your project with Ordeq.
You can add new nodes and IO without changing existing code.
Each transformation is modular and isolated.

#### Running the pipeline

Meanwhile, the `run` function takes care of loading the inputs and saving the outputs of each node.
You no longer need to route the inputs and outputs of each transformation through the functions.
Dependencies between nodes are automatically resolved.
