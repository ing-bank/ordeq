# Marimo

[Marimo](https://docs.marimo.io/) is an open-source reactive Python notebook. An improved version of Jupyter notebooks, Marimo allows you to build data applications with interactive widgets and reactive cells.

This example demonstrates how to use Ordeq within a Marimo notebook to create an interactive data application.

Even though this example is written for Marimo, you can run similar code in a Jupyter notebook as well to run Ordeq in the interactive environment of your choice.

Try it out directly in the embedded Marimo notebook below:
