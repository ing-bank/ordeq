# Machine learning with PyTorch

This project is based on an example from Dagster to demonstrate what code with similar functionality looks like in both frameworks.
See also the original [pipeline guide](https://docs.dagster.io/examples/ml) and [dagster implementation](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples/docs_projects/project_ml)

Simply run the entire project using the following `uv` command:
